Problem - A Cat, a Parrot, and a Bag of Seed:
In this problem, a man is tasked with moving three items across a river in a boat that is only big enough to carry himself and one other item. The three items are a cat, a parrot, and a bag of seed. The issue becomes that when the man has taken one of the items, what will the consequences be of leaving the other two behind? If the parrot is left alone with the seed, the seed will be eaten; and, if the cat is left alone with the parrot, the parrot will be eaten. Knowing this, it becomes obvious that the cat cannot be left alone with the parrot and the parrot cannot be left alone with the bag of seed. A possible solution would be to isolate the cat with the seed because the cat will not be interested in the seed and the parrot will be safe. 
My solution came to the following:
First, the man will take the parrot across the river. Next, the man will go back to the side of the river where he left the cat and seed. He will then take the seed across to the side where he left the parrot. At this step, the man will be standing on the destination side of the river with the seed and the parrot. He will then take the bird back across the river to the side that the cat is on. He will leave the bird and take the cat back across to the side that has the seed. Then, the man will go back across the river alone, collect the parrot, and return to the destination side of the river with all three objects in tact.
When solving this problem, I envisioned how the scenario would play out if he took the cat or the seed first. The solution seemed to come fairly easily because of the constraints of the problem.
